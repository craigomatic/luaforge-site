<h3 id="so_what_happened_to_luaforge">So, what happened to luaforge?</h3>
<p>LuaForge was running GForge, which involved a lot of services and there was no admin resources to keep all of this up in a reliable and sustainable way.
So, the scope of the services got reduced, so that there is less offered now, but in a way that should be sustainable under available resources. For the most part it means that most of the content has been preserved, but in a static format. At the moment, the only way to make any changes is by emailing us. (This may change.)</p>
<h3 id="really_it_looks_the_same_to_me">Really? It looks the same to me!</h3>
<p>Maybe you are still accessing an old server. Domain propagation might take a few days.</p>
<h3 id="the_new_website_looks_seriously_ugly_what_can_be_done_about_it">The new website looks seriously ugly! What can be done about it?</h3>
<p>Part of this might be because migration is in progress and some pages look a bit different.
However, you are welcome to volunteer your artistic skills to improve the look of the site</p>
<h3 id="who_do_i_contact_with_questions_and_requests">Who do I contact with questions and requests?</h3>
<p>Please email <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#108;&#117;&#97;&#102;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#101;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#108;&#117;&#97;&#102;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#101;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a> with all questions. In particular, whenever it says "email us" in below, this means "email <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#108;&#117;&#97;&#102;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#101;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#108;&#117;&#97;&#102;&#111;&#114;&#103;&#101;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>.

   If you give us a new URL, then we can setup a "301 Redirect". (B) If you give us an IP address, then we can setup a new DNS record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can put create a github project / branch for your website, put the content there, and ask us to pull the content.</p>

<h3 id="what_happened_to_all_the_released_files">What happened to all the released files?</h3>
