Great plans... Little time... and actually what is there to Build or Deploy in a dynamic language?
Should have read "Java - Build, Test, Deploy" but Lua lured me into dropping Java (which was outgrowing??? me).
jUnit inspired unit testing (originally LuaUnit based) is the only production quality component.
There is also a (windows only) IUP robot.
